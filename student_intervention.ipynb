In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

The recommended way to handle such a column is to create as many columns as possible values (e.g. `Fjob_teacher`, `Fjob_other`, `Fjob_services`, etc.), and assign a `1` to one of them and `0` to all others.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Strength: It is very simple, fast, indepent on dimensionality, requiring small amount of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses: The assumption is over simlified which result in poor performance if independence assumptions are not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fittness: For this case, the data amount is relatively small, and the features amount is relatively large. Since the independence assumption is true, I want to use it for a quick trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Trees:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application:. The decision tree can be used for predicting library book use or even for star/cosmic-ray classification in Hubble space telescope images. Here is the paper link:http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780124438804/leondes_expert_vol1_ch3.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strength: It is easy to understand and requiring small amount of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses: It is easy to get overfitted and sensitive to noise. The model's complexity increases expoentially as the feature increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Fittness:  A decision tree splits a set of data into smaller and smaller groups by one feature at a time and in this case most our feature is binary and the result we want to predict is also binary. So I think decision tree might be a good model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: It can provide a brief historical background on inductive learning and pattern recognition and thus be useful in business. Here is the book chapter link: http://www.irma-international.org/viewtitle/26134/\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strength: It is memory efficient due to using subset of training points in support vector. It provides different Kernal functions which can be good for different situation. It works effectively with large feature size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses: It is wasy to be overfitted if the features are too many. It can only be used in classification problems. It has poor performance is number of features is much greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fittness: In this case, most of the feature data and the target data are categorical or even binary. Also, the feature size are relatively large. So SVM might be a good choice."

    "In this final section, you will choose from the three supervised learning models the *best* model to use on the student data. You will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F<sub>1</sub> score.

    "The best model is SVM. From the table above, we can see the decision tree model give us the worst testing F1 score while the training F1 score is 1.This means the decision tree was overfitted in this case due to lots of the features we would like to explore. For Gaussian Naive Bayes which has the shortest training and prediction time,  although it gave us a better score than decision tree, it limited its performance not allowing any fine tuning. For the SVM, it gave us the best F1 scores for both training and testing. Also, we can tune it to have a better performance. Although it has the longest training and prediction time, but considering the the absolute value of time does not really hurt in this situation, I decided to choose this model.  "

    "For simplicity, a SVM is a method to draw a best line to seperate apart two group of points. Figure 1 represent two group of points, red and green. There are many ways to draw lines to seperate them, like line a, b, and c. However line b is the best since it balance the distance from both group of the points. Sometimes, the groups of points may not be seperated by a line like which is shown in Figure 2 (a). However, if we transfter the position of these points with some function, like what is shown in Figure 2 (b), we are able to draw the line to seperate it."
